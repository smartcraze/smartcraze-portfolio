# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my skills, achievements, and recent work as a full-stack developer.

## About Me

I'm a passionate and driven full-stack developer with expertise in React, Node.js, Next.js, Python, Django, and SEO. I’ve built a variety of web applications, from dynamic front-end interfaces to complex back-end systems. Whether you need a sleek website, a custom web application, or even improvements in performance and SEO, I’m here to help.

Alongside my development experience, I've also participated in hackathons, winning multiple competitions, and I am a selected participant in the prestigious Smart India Hackathon (SIH). My coding journey has also led me to be selected as a Tier 1 coder at Outlier, where I actively engage in honing my skills and sharing knowledge in the field of programming.
