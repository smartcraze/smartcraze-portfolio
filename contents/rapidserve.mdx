# 🚀 RapidServe – Vercel-Style App Deployment Platform

<Note type="success">
  RapidServe is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that lets developers deploy full-stack apps directly from their GitHub repositories using Docker-based builds and cloud infrastructure — think of it like your own mini-Vercel.
</Note>

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🐳 **Docker-Based Builds**  
  Pulls repo code, generates Docker images, and deploys containers.

- 🖥️ **GitHub Integration**  
  Auto-deploy from your GitHub repos with webhook triggers.

- ☁️ **AWS Lambda Functions**  
  Supports dynamic serverless functions for APIs or compute logic.

- 🗃️ **S3 Storage Integration**  
  Store static assets or build outputs in S3 buckets seamlessly.

- 📊 **Dashboard UI**  
  Monitor deployments, check logs, and manage build status visually.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Docker CLI  
- **Cloud**: AWS Lambda, S3, ECR (optional)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Webhooks + Custom Build Pipeline  
- **Infra**: Docker, Nginx (for reverse proxy)
