# AskSuraj 🤖 — Portfolio RAG Assistant **(LIVE AVAILABLE ON HOME PAGE)**

**AskSuraj** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered assistant designed to answer questions about my portfolio, skills, projects, and experiences using natural language.

It uses vector-based semantic search to retrieve relevant information and generates responses using an LLM. This project showcases my ability to integrate AI, NLP, and fullstack development into a smart, job-ready portfolio tool.
