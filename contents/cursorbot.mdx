<Note type="success">
  <strong>CursorBot</strong> is your AI-powered animation assistant that takes a simple idea and transforms it into a clean, elegant animation using the <code>manim</code> engine — no manual frame-by-frame coding required.
</Note>

## 🧠 What is CursorBot?

CursorBot is a GenAI-powered tool that converts **natural language prompts** into **Manim-based 2D animations**.

You describe what you want — CursorBot writes the code, compiles it, and serves you back a rendered animation.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✍️ **Prompt-to-Animation**: Converts natural language into Python animation scripts  
- 🎞️ **Powered by Manim**: Uses the Manim engine for precision, math visuals, and graphing  
- 🤖 **AI Agent Backend**: Parses intent, builds scenes, and dynamically configures camera/objects  
- 💬 **Live Preview + Replay**: Preview animations instantly or tweak them with follow-up prompts  
- 🧩 **Modular Output**: Export MP4s, GIFs, or raw Manim Python code for full control  
- 🧪 **CLI + Web UI**: Use it via terminal or modern web interface (built with React + Tailwind)

## 📸 Example Prompt

> "Animate a sine wave with axes and label the peak points."

**Resulting Animation:**

```py
class SineWaveScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        axes = Axes()
        sine = axes.plot(lambda x: np.sin(x), color=BLUE)
        self.add(axes, sine)
````
