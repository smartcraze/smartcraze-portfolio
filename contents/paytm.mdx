# 💸 Paytm-Style Transaction Flow (Mock)

A simple **Next.js demo** showcasing how a Paytm-like transaction works — focusing on the backend flow, UI transitions, and callback handling (no real payment gateway integration).

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔁 **Simulated Payment Flow** (Create Order → Redirect → Callback)
* 🧾 **Mock Transaction Status** handling like Paytm’s response
* 📩 **Backend APIs** to create orders and receive simulated callbacks
* 🌐 **Dynamic Pages** for loading, redirecting, and confirmation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
* **Backend**: API Routes (Node/Express-style in Next.js)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## 🧱 How It Works

```plaintext
User → Create Order → Mock Redirect → Callback API → Success Page
```

* `POST /api/create-order`: Simulates order creation
* `GET /redirect`: Mocks Paytm redirect page
* `POST /api/callback`: Simulates Paytm hitting your server with txn result
* `GET /success`: Final confirmation screen

## 🧠 What I Learned

* Mimicking real-world transaction flows
* Handling redirect-based payments in a full-stack app
* Structuring serverless API routes in Next.js
* Managing state across async events and page transitions
