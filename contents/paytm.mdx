# 💸 Paytm-Style Transaction Flow (Mock)

<Note type="info">
  This is a simulated payment experience built with <strong>Next.js</strong>. It recreates Paytm's order–redirect–callback cycle for learning and prototyping.
</Note>

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔁 **Simulated Payment Flow** — Create Order → Redirect → Callback  
- 🧾 **Mock Transaction Status** — Pretend payment result from gateway  
- 📩 **Backend APIs** — Serverless handlers for callbacks  
- 🌐 **Dynamic Routing** — App Router pages for success & loading screens  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Backend**: Serverless API routes (`/api`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

---

## 🧱 How It Works

```plaintext
User → Create Order → Mock Redirect → Callback API → Success Page
````

| Endpoint                 | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `POST /api/create-order` | Simulates order creation       |
| `GET /redirect`          | Mocks payment redirection page |
| `POST /api/callback`     | Handles fake gateway callback  |
| `GET /success`           | Final screen with success info |

## 🧠 What I Learned

* 🧩 Building realistic payment flow simulations
* 🌐 Handling full redirect-based payments in Next.js
* 📦 Using API routes for backend control in the App Router
* 🔁 Managing async transitions across UI screens
